# CODSOFT_Data-Science
Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! Here, I’ve worked on three different machine learning projects, each tackling a unique problem—predicting survival, classifying flowers, and forecasting sales.
These projects cover everything from data preprocessing and visualization to model building and evaluation using Python. If you're curious about how machine learning works in real-world scenarios, you're in the right place!

Projects Included
1. Titanic Survival Prediction – Can we predict who survived the Titanic disaster?
2. Iris Flower Classification - Can we classify flowers based on petal and sepal measurements?
3. Sales Prediction Using Python – How much will a company sell based on advertising spend?
Each project includes data cleaning, model training, and performance evaluation, so let's dive in!

**TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION**

What's the goal:
The Titanic dataset is famous in the world of data science. It contains information about passengers who either survived or didn't make it. Our task? Use machine learning to predict survival based on passenger details like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

How we did it:
Cleaned the data by filling missing values and encoding categories.
Engineered new features, like family size, to enhance predictions.
Trained a Random Forest model to classify passengers as "Survived" or "Not Survived."
Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance.

What we learned:
Women and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.
Family size had an impact—being alone reduced survival chances.
Random Forest performed well, capturing key patterns in survival.

**IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

What's the goal:
This classic dataset contains measurements of three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The challenge? Train a model to classify flowers based on petal and sepal dimensions.

How we did it:
Visualized the data with scatter plots to explore patterns.
Trained a Random Forest model to classify flowers accurately.
Checked model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance.
Tested the model on new data points to see if it could correctly predict flower species.

What we learned:
Petal length and width were the most important features in classification.
The model achieved high accuracy, making it reliable for new flower predictions.
Data visualization helped us understand clear separations between species.

**SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON**

What's the goal:
Ever wondered how much a company will sell based on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising? This project uses linear regression to predict sales revenue based on ad spend.

How we did it:
Cleaned the dataset and checked for missing values.
Built a Linear Regression model to predict sales.
Evaluated model accuracy using Mean Squared Error and R² Score.
Visualized actual vs predicted sales to understand performance.

What we learned:
TV advertising had the biggest impact on sales.
Newspaper ads were less effective compared to TV and radio.
Linear regression provided good predictions, but there’s always room for improvement!

Why These Projects Matter
These projects helped me explore different machine learning concepts—classification, regression, feature engineering, and data visualization. Each dataset tells a story, and machine learning helps us uncover insights that might not be obvious at first glance.
